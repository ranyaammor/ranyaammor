Hello!👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Ranya, and I'm passionate about data and finance 🔍💼.
I currently live in Montreal, Canada 🇨🇦, a vibrant and diverse city known for its multiculturalism and freezing winters ❄️.
My journey into the world of analytics started with my desire to understand how analytics can overcome the complexities of personal finance.
Since then, I've developed a deep interest in Financial Analytics.

In my professional experience, I've worked at BDC (Development Bank of Canada), where I analyzed the financial data of over 50 bankrupt startups, identifying discrepancies in liabilities and drafting precise legal documents used by syndicates and lawyers. My detailed analysis improved bankruptcy proceedings for companies with $1M+ in debt, ensuring smooth communication of liabilities and reducing delays. At McGill’s RedBirds SportShop, I leveraged sales, financial, and social media data to design targeted marketing campaigns and social media posts, boosting product visibility and driving a 10% profit increase in just six months.

I hold a Bachelor's in Finance and Business Analytics from McGill University, and seeing the impact data could have on personal finance management, I decided to dive deeper by pursuing a Master of Management in Analytics at McGill as well.
Through this program, I aim to further refine my analytical skills and apply them to create impactful financial solutions for both individuals and businesses.

The projects on my page are the course projects that I enjoyed the most, and they reflect my journey through analytics and finance—feel free to check them out! 
They represent some of the practical skills I've gained along the way.

Outside of work, I love traveling, especially going on road trips with my family 🌍.
We’ve done Route 66, the West Coast, and Eastern Europe so far! I also adore watching movies and exploring cinema from all countries 🎬.
I’m super open-minded when it comes to films, as you can find excellent ones that aren't necessarily mainstream. My favorite movie this year is Le Comte de Monte Cristo.

I’m fluent in Arabic, French, and English, and always eager to learn something new.
I was born in Canada, and I’m Moroccan-Canadian. I also lived in Dubai for 17 years, which gave me a unique perspective on cultures and experiences.
You can often find me at the gym 🏋️‍♀️, cooking 🍳, or catching up on the latest trends in personal finance and technology 📚.

All the best,
