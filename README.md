Hello!👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Ranya, and I'm passionate about data and finance 🔍💼.
I currently live in Montreal, Canada 🇨🇦, a vibrant and diverse city known for its multiculturalism and freezing winters ❄️.
My journey into the world of analytics started with my desire to understand how analytics can overcome the complexities of personal finance.
Since then, I've developed a deep interest in Financial Analytics.

I’ve worked as a Special Accounts Analyst at the Development Bank of Canada, where I analyzed financial data for bankrupt startups, and as a Research Assistant at RedBirds SportShop McGill, where I optimized sales using data-driven strategies. 
These roles helped me refine my skills and explore how data can solve real-world financial challenges.
During my time in Dubai, I also taught personal finance fundamentals to individuals navigating a fast-paced, high-consumption economy.
This sparked my curiosity to apply data analytics to create meaningful personalized financial solutions.

I hold a Bachelor's in Finance and Business Analytics from McGill University, and seeing the impact data could have on personal finance management, I decided to dive deeper by pursuing a Master of Management in Analytics at McGill as well.
Through this program, I aim to further refine my analytical skills and apply them to create impactful financial solutions for both individuals and businesses.

Outside of work, I love traveling, especially going on road trips with my family 🌍.
We’ve done Route 66, the West Coast, and Eastern Europe so far! I also adore watching movies and exploring cinema from all countries 🎬.
I’m super open-minded when it comes to films, as you can find excellent ones that aren't necessarily mainstream. My favorite movie this year is Le Comte de Monte Cristo.

I’m fluent in Arabic, French, and English, and always eager to learn something new.
I was born in Canada, and I’m Moroccan-Canadian. I also lived in Dubai for 17 years, which gave me a unique perspective on cultures and experiences.
You can often find me at the gym 🏋️‍♀️, cooking 🍳, or catching up on the latest trends in personal finance and technology 📚.

Feel free to connect if you share similar interests or want to collaborate!

Best regards,
Ranya
